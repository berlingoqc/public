I first start with my technical degree in “Industrial” Computer Science from the Cégep de Lévis-Lauzon in 2013 finishing it in 2018 after many leave because my main focus them was on having fun and playing sports.\nI first start in the degree by learning the base of computer science in the not soo wonderful to me ecosystem of C# in .Net 4.5 and Visual Studio. With some basic Form application , i didn’t like it a lot at first because i found it way to lock in a particular ecosystem.\nMy first love was when i was doing some small projects in Python , i found the liberty of the syntax to be very freeing with dynamic typing and awsome one liner. But i havent really reach back in python since.\nMy projects in python where some small code for rasberry pi to play with the gpio and a TFTP client to go along a TFTP server that i wrote as a assignment for school in C# , the code are still presents in my GitHub.\nAfter that i went throw a difficul time in my life , very lost and quit school. During that time i start to mess around with golang. It was my first true love. The tooling was insane , the packet manager , the documentation and i love the simplicity of it. I start really to dive into linux , vim and open source software at that point and it continue ever since.\nMe , a newly introduce friend and my uncle start a little project for a automated greenhouse system call growbe (this name will come back afterward but it was the first try) i play a lot but was not able to finish anything. Those time introduce myself with : Grpc , protobuf , targetting different architecture with my code , doing some serial communication with a wifi chip.\nAfter that i went back to finish my degree with a awsome class of motivated programmer. This was trully my best year as a young developer. The degree being focus on industrial application with work a lot with robots , camera , interprogram communication , threading and we where trully free to work as we like. While my class stay in Visual Studio and microsoft c compiler i really dig myself in modern C++.\nWorking with CMake , C++17 and linux i work on the following projects:\n ARDrone : a client to control the ARDrone and use the video camera to do self control ( we didnt finish mutch of the last part) YASE : a little OpenGL application to create 3D scene with the help on “egui” Constard : a Unreal Engine 4 moba video game that include multiplayer and VR support ( a single project for the whole classe of 12)  I really grow during those times.\nAfter that came the job market and i was not that mutch interess to work (except to make easy money compare to work in the kitchen). I had done some basic Angular application for a class and i took the closest job to my appartement witch was Desjardins a big bank in the province of Québec. I was working as a full stack developer working on some Frontend for Backend in Spring Boot and with some frontend application and sometime some boring old java servlet application. I was a terrible experiences for me. I didn’t found to have people there to help me and to integrate me in the team. I was mostly left alone to do nothing in my corner and i took some of the compagny time ( most at the end ) to work on my personal projects. Because nobody seem to care of what i was doing and most people didn’t seem care that mutch , just earny a living. After my first time there as a intern they offer my a basic entry job witch a accept because i just didn’t care. They where saying how good working i was even if i did nothing. I didn’t really like this attitude of pleasing the employee with false compliment or i don’t know what those compliment where but it really just give me the taste to leave so i leave and left to work on my projects for some months before having no money left and i had to found a new job.\nDuring this time i work on a application call (DM)[https://github.com/berlingoqc/dm] it stand for DownloadManager it’s an all in one application that i wrote in Goland and Angular . The goal was to be a software that you can download with and create some basic pipeline to do work on your file afterward. Like downloading a torrent movie in MKV and converting it to MP4 , removing the non sens naming and move it to my movie folder on my mac, that was the goal. I really help me but i didn’t finish the projects i stop it when i got a new job and havent touch it yet , the motivation just left me.\nMy next job was a small ingeneering company, i was the only developer when i arrive i remaing the only developer for a long time. I had to maintain and add feature to there inner portal for human ressource , write from a port of a old PHP application by two intern. One did the backend in Loopback3 and the frontend in Angular. They both left the compagny with little information about the projects. So when i arrive i was really in the dark but i was one of the bet experiences for me.\nI really learn alot about this stack of loopback and angular , created library to shared code between projects and it was my favorite things to do , create utility library for Angular.\nDuring this time i created two of my most use library:\n (angular libs)[https://github.com/berlingoqc/angular-libs] (loopback4 libs)[https://github.com/berlingoqc/lb-extensions]  I start those idea as thing for the compagny but i quickly rewrote them and expand them for my own need. I was having a lot of freedom and i develop most of my stack that latter quick start the big project i’m working on at the moment of writing this text: Growbe.\nGrowbe was the project that i start with a friend some years ago and now was time for round 2.
