This is a project that i start to live my long forgotten dream of creating a video
game. Like most kids in my computer science degree , we all dreamt of creating video
game but now most of use are working of web app and full stack development , easy work ,
easy pay check and many oportunies.

To get myself back at it and to learn even more of the rust programming language i start
this project using `rust` + `bevy`.

You can follow my dev log and my release here on this blog , i don't give to many exemple
but i talk about my struggle and misery on the way to my end goals.

You can try the game in the web [here](https://berlingoqc.github.io/cod-zombie-2d-clone/)
