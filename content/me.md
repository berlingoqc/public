## William Quintal aka berlingoqc

Hello my name is William Quintal , i'm a developer from the nation of Québec (currently trap in the country of Canada).

I create this website to write about my experiences related to programmation, my opinions and to post release and stuff
about my too [many projects](/public/projects/).

## My journey as a programmer

It's been a while since a first start programming in 2013 but at first i didn't feel that mutch passionate about it.
I first start with my technical degree in "Industrial" Computer Science from the Cégep de Lévis-Lauzon in 2013 finishing
it in 2018 after many leave because my main focus them was on having fun and playing sports.

I first start in the degree by learning the base of computer science in the not soo wonderful to me ecosystem of C# in
.Net 4.5 and Visual Studio. With some basic Form application , i didn't like it a lot at first because i found it way
to lock in a particular ecosystem.

My first love was when i was doing some small projects in Python , i found the liberty of the syntax to be very freeing
with dynamic typing and awsome one liner. But i havent really reach back in python since.

My projects in python where some small code for rasberry pi to play with the gpio and a TFTP client to go along a TFTP
server that i wrote as a assignment for school in C# , the code are still presents in my GitHub.

After that i went throw a difficul time in my life , very lost and quit school. During that time i start to mess around with
golang. It was my first true love. The tooling was insane , the packet manager , the documentation and i love the
simplicity of it. I start really to dive into linux , vim and open source software at that point and it continue
ever since.

Me , a newly introduce friend and my uncle start a little project for a automated greenhouse system call growbe
(this name will come back afterward but it was the first try) i play a lot but was not able to finish anything.
Those time introduce myself with : Grpc , protobuf , targetting different architecture with my code , doing
some serial communication with a wifi chip.

After that i went back to finish my degree with a awsome class of motivated programmer. This was trully my best
year as a young developer. The degree being focus on industrial application with work a lot with robots , camera ,
interprogram communication , threading and we where trully free to work as we like. While my class stay in Visual
Studio and microsoft c compiler i really dig myself in modern C++.

Working with CMake , C++17 and linux i work on the following projects:

* ARDrone : a client to control the ARDrone and use the video camera to do self control ( we didnt finish mutch of the last part)
* YASE : a little OpenGL application to create 3D scene with the help on "egui"
* Constard : a Unreal Engine 4 moba video game that include  multiplayer and VR support ( a single project for the whole classe of 12)

I really grow during those times.

After that came the job market and i was not that mutch interess to work (except to make easy money compare to work in the kitchen).
I had done some basic Angular application for a class and i took the closest job to my appartement witch was Desjardins a big bank
in the province of Québec. I was working as a full stack developer working on some Frontend for Backend in Spring Boot and with some
frontend application and sometime some boring old java servlet application. I was a terrible experiences for me. I didn't found
to have people there to help me and to integrate me in the team. I was mostly left alone to do nothing in my corner and i took some
of the compagny time ( most at the end ) to work on my personal projects. Because nobody seem to care of what i was doing and most
people didn't seem care that mutch , just earny a living. After my first time there as a intern they offer my a basic entry job
witch a accept because i just didn't care. They where saying how good working i was even if i did nothing. I didn't really like
this attitude of pleasing the employee with false compliment or i don't know what those compliment where but it really just give 
me the taste to leave so i leave and left to work on my projects for some months before having no money left and i had to found a
new job.

During this time i work on a application call (DM)[https://github.com/berlingoqc/dm] it stand for DownloadManager it's an all
in one application that i wrote in Goland and Angular . The goal was to be a software that you can download with and create some 
basic pipeline to do work on your file afterward. Like downloading a torrent movie in MKV and converting it to MP4 , removing the
non sens naming and move it to my movie folder on my mac, that was the goal. I really help me but i didn't finish the projects
i stop it when i got a new job and havent touch it yet , the motivation just left me.


My next job was a small ingeneering company, i was the only developer when i arrive i remaing the only developer for a long time.
I had to maintain and add feature to there inner portal for human ressource , write from a port of a old PHP application by two
intern. One did the backend in Loopback3 and the frontend in Angular. They both left the compagny with little information about
the projects. So when i arrive i was really in the dark but i was one of the bet experiences for me.

I really learn alot about this stack of loopback and angular , created library to shared code between projects and it was my
favorite things to do , create utility library for Angular.

During this time i created two of my most use library:

* (angular libs)[https://github.com/berlingoqc/angular-libs]
* (loopback4 libs)[https://github.com/berlingoqc/lb-extensions]


I start those idea as thing for the compagny but i quickly rewrote them and expand them for my own need.
I was having a lot of freedom and i develop most of my stack that latter quick start the big project i'm working on at
the moment of writing this text: Growbe.

Growbe was the project that i start with a friend some years ago and now was time for round 2. He had remade the design
of the hardware with a modular approch ( you can read more on the website of the project (here)[https://doc.growbe.ca]
