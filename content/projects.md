## Active Projects

I'm working on the following projects:

### [growbe](https://growbe.ca)

My biggest project to date. This is a end to end modulable solution for envrionment control (mainly greenhouse).
A projects that i start many years ago with a friend who make the board, the hardware and the firmware and
i'm in charge of all the code (IoT , cloud and infrastrucutre ).

A really cool project that will soon reach some level of maturity. The stack consist of:

* k8s (infra)
* rust (IoT)
* C (firmware)
* Angular (frontend)
* nodejs (all the microservice)

### [angular libs](https://angular-libs.web.app/)

Collection of angular library that i made for the growbe project.

The most interessing one are:

* ngx-autoform : Angular reactive form generated from code
* ngx-autotable : Angular table generated from code

### [cod-zombie-2d-clone](https://github.com/berlingoqc/cod-zombie-2d-clone)

I project that i start recently to get myself in the video game development world, 
the reason that i start programming but quickly forgot.

This is a clone of the popular call of duty zombie mode recreated in 2d with
the bevy engine in rust.

I'm writting a log about my development in the website and i'm planning to
livestream and make a video series about my development.
