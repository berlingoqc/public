I'm flexible and i can create a special course for your need based on my
experiences and knowledge [you can read more about this here](/public/me)

My values are about sharing knowledge and openness.

All teaching that i will do will be open source and free to access by all other
people on this website. All learning material should be free to access.

### Introduction to programming to get into web development

This is the first course that i'm bulding to teach for a dear friend
of mine who want to learn programming after his master in philosophy.

The starting point for this course is being a PC gamer with no prior
experiences about software programming and networking. Being a PC gamer
i know some things be name being confront with things from time to time.

The ending point would be to be knowledgeable of modern front-end development
with understanding of the cloud and how to work in this modern virtual space
with good understanding of deeper concept of programmation to really open
all the gate for is future independent work afterward. Because the main goal
should always be independant. I think of a teacher of computer science as 
a starter on a motor , all i need is to start the beast and unleash it.

So the topic for this classe must be:

* Introduction to programmation
        * How do we write code from source code to executable. ( PC architecture , assembly , compiler , linker and shared library )
        * What are the paradigm of programming. (oop , structural , functional )
        * The different flavor of language. (interpreted vs compiled vs both together)
        * Start the base of programming (condition , loop and variable type )
        * Object Orientated how do me organize code in 1995 (Class , interface , inheritance , polymorphism )
        * Functional Programming how do we not bore ourself with abstraction and classe ( first order function , mixin )
        * I don't want to do things all be myself welcome to Framework and Library with the help of packet manager
        * Doctor i need a editor to help my migrain from writing code in a basic text editor
        * First little project an application that but all of this together
        * Scripting is fun , i can do things other that manually :0
* The cloud
        * What , Where and Who is the damn cloud.
        * How do i get my code there (DNS , webserver and Paas)
        * We gona need a bigger ship to learn Docker
        * How do we scale this ? kubernetes is hard or is it ?
* Web programming
        * I just put things inside <> and i design an interface.
        * Things getting pretty with the help of css
        * But how do we move things , thanks go javascript is a sound language
        * But how do we shared dynamic information help me database
        * Time to choice a development stack for a fullstack application
        * Get your end dirty it's time to code mofo

The language use in this class:

* bash ( for scripting and for being apart from normal languge )
* python ( for scripting in a "real" language and for dynamic typing )
* go ( to learn the base of programming , compilation , library and learning from the doc )
* Typescript or javascript front-end ( depending of the choice of the student in framework for the final project )
* Typescript or go or kotlin ( depending of the choice of the student in framework for the final project )
